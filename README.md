PIC - Python Interactive Chat for learning Python and chatting live

Imagine a server, similar to discord, that's built for developers.  Beginners and Experienced users can connect and discuss programming with one another while also able to run through examples with an interactive programming tool builtin to the chat client.  That's what I hope to bring with this Application.
